SendTab
=======

Nothing to see for now…

SendTab will be constituted of 3 parts:

 - a bookmarklet to "send" browser tabs (links in fact).
 - a node.js + socket.io server to receive the tab and send it to the target.
 - a web-app (always opened, in a pinned tab for example…) to (finally!) receive the tab and open it.

Ideas
=====

 - inbox of tabs
 - bookmarklet displays a list of targets (other devices, friends…)
 - auto open tabs from trusted sources
